# Collaborative Design Web Platform: Python Toolkit

Paul T. Grogan, [ptgrogan@stevens.edu](mailto:pgrogan@stevens.edu)

## Introduction

This software generates experiment session files and post-processes data recorded during experimental sessions. The data from these experiments takes two forms: a JSON file which describes the technical problems in the experiment (coupling matrices, input and output assignments, and labels), and a log file which records the actions taken by participants during the experimental session.

## Pre-requisites

This software is written in Python and requires either version 2.X or 3.X with the `numpy` and `scipy.linalg` packages. The authors recommend an integrated Python environment such as Anaconda for ease of use.

## Generator Usage

The `generator.py` script is used to generate experiment files for each session following a particular experimental design. The default generator follows the following rules:
 * 5 Training Tasks
  1. 1x1 Individual
  2. 2x2 Individual
  3. 2x2 (Uncoupled) Pair
  4. 2x2 Pair
  5. 3x3 Pair
 * 10 Experimental Tasks (Randomized Order)
  * 2 replications of 2x2 Individual
  * 2 replications of 3x3 Individual
  * 3 replications of 2x2 Pair
  * 3 replications of 3x3 Pair

After running, the generator will output a JSON file (`experimentXXX.json`) for each requested experimental session.

## Post-processor Usage

The `processor.py` script is used to post-process experiment results to support analysis. It accepts two command-line arguments:
```shell
python processor.py -l [log_file] -j [json_file]
```
where `[log_file]` is the file path to the resulting log file written by the server during the experiment and `[json_file]` is the file path to the original JSON experiment document created by the generator script.

After running, the processor script will output to standard out (console) a table showing the time and score of each participant in each round.
