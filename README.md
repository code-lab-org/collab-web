# Collaborative Design Web Platform (collab-web)

Paul T. Grogan, [ptgrogan@stevens.edu](mailto:pgrogan@stevens.edu)

## Introduction

This project contains two components in support of Collaborative Design experiments:

1. Python Toolkit - a set of Python scripts that generate experiments and post-process resulting log files
2. Web Application - a client-server Node.js application to conduct designer experiments

More information on both components is provided in the subdirectory README files.

This project implements a similar interface to a [prior project](https://github.com/ptgrogan/collab); however, without requiring an IEEE 1516-2010 High Level Architecture (HLA) runtime infrastructure (RTI).

## Requirements

You must have Python (compatible with version 2 or 3) installed on your machine to run the Python toolkit.

You must have Node.js installed on your server to run the web application.
